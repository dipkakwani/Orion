# CLAP (Causal Look Ahead Partition) Key Value Store

Built on top of DKVF (https://github.com/roohitavaf/DKVF)

## TODO

1. Implement ROT for Causal Spartan in DKVF
   1. Algorithm described in the paper - CausalSpartanX: Causal Consistency and Non-Blocking Read-Only Transactions https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.07123.pdf
   2. ROT implementation available in MSUDB https://github.com/roohitavaf/MSUDB
2. Implement minimum partition optimisation
3. Check multiple versions
